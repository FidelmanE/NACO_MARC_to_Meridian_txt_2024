These scripts, provided to OCLC in Dec. 2024, use pymarc to convert NACO records in MARC authority format to tab-delimited (.txt), providing clearer delimitation of subfields (quoted, comma separated where ISBD in NACO often contains semicolons) than MARCEdit and dummy characters in subfields so they line up correctly.  One script provides a NACO record per row (or one 100$a per row) and one provides one 670 note field per row to show even more clearly which information lines up with which URL's or source location(s).
